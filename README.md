 k-DPP for subset selection using VLMC distances

This repository contains an example on how to use DPPy and Tensorflow to sample exactly from k-DPP and evaluate log probability.

Input: Pairwise distances between VLMC

Output: Samples from k-DPP

#### Requirement
* to generate pairwise distances between VLMC, please install [dvstar](https://github.com/Schlieplab/dvstar) 
* [DPPy](https://github.com/guilgautier/DPPy)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)


TODO: improve conversion from distance to similarity, implement Gibbs sampling
