## kdpp
 k-DPP

Input: Pairwise distances between VLMC
Output: Samples from k-DPP

Dependency: , DPPy and Tensorflow

An example on how to use DPPy and Tensorflow to sample exactly from k-DPP and evaluate log probability.

TODO: improve conversion from distance to similarity, implement Gibbs sampling
